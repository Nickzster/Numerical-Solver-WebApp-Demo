# Differential Equations Numerical Solver App

Description: This is an app that I developed when I started working in React. Although the code is quite old, it is still a good working concept of a potential app that models first order ODE's utilizing numerical methods. In light of COVID-19, I wanted to build a better version of this app to model the SIR model, which is why I dug it up and posted it.
